        <p>
          Stewardship is the grateful response of a Christian who recognizes and honors God as the
          source of every blessing. It is our offering of time, talent, and treasure back to God
          through the life of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your generous support enables Saint Demetrios to maintain our beautiful church, support
          our clergy and staff, fund our ministries and outreach programs, and serve our community
          in the name of Christ.
        </p>
        <p className="font-heading text-lg italic text-ink-800">
          We invite every family and individual to prayerfully consider making a stewardship pledge
          for this year.
